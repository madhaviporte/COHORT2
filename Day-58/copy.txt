class expression--> variable class save krte hai

hoisting--> var bnanne se pahle ham useee use kr skte hai.

inheritence = agr koi class hai jisme kuchh kuchh likha hia appp mantte ho ek nayi class usi ka extension hai to app wo sare features purani class se borrow kar skte ho and nayi class me use kar skte ho and apna nayi feature bhi bna skte ho

Section 1: objects and OOps Thinking (foundation)

1) Create a user object that stores name and email and has a login methos which prints "user logged in".
2) imagine you now have 5 users.
first, think how you would manage them without using a class
then convert the same logic using a class and observe how the code becomes cleaner . write code for both approaches.
3) Create a product object that stores name and price and has a method which return the final price after discount.
4)the goal of this section is to understand why keeping data 
behaviour together makes code easier to manage.

section 2: Classes and Objects
1) create a car class with the following:
brand
speed
a drive method that prints the car brand and speed 

2)create two differnt car object from the same class and verify that thir data is different.

// Answer this in your own words:
if classes did not exist, how would you write this logic and what problem might occure when the project becomes large?

Section 3: Constructor or this keyword

1) create a student class whose constructor accepts name and roll number.
// add a method intoduce that prints both values.

2) Inside the constructor, set values using this.
// then try removing this and notice what error occure and why.

3)Create an object with two methods:
//one methos using a normal function
//one method using an arrow function

Section:4 Constructor Function and prototypes
(//bina class ke bhi constructon function bantta hai
// es6 se pahle constructor function aise banta tha)

YTV= Advance js me time(2hour to 3h)

// create a user constructor function (do not use class syntax),

// add a login method in two ways:
// first, inside the constructor
// then, mmove the method to the prototype

//Create two user object and compare their login methods using equality.
//Explain why the result is true or false.

//the purpose here is to understand how prototypes help share behavior efficiently.
